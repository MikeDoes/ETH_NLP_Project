Pursuant to \nESA's effort to more fully integrate its regional operations with the \noperations of companies (such as TGS, Transredes, EPE, and the various \nelements of the ESA Gas Business Unit) not controlled by Enron but in which \nEnron has substantial investments, we are particularly interested in \nimproving the quality and quantity of information being received from the \nlegal departments of these jointly-owned companies. \n\nTo facilitate greater communication, I have formed two standing committees:  \na legal management committee for ESA and a regional general counsels \ncommittee. Each will meet once a week, for no more than one hour and 15 \nminutes.  Their purposes will be to provide forums for the reporting and \ndiscussion of significant legal issues and activities affecting ESA's \nregional operations and investments. \n\nThe Legal Management Meeting will be comprised of the subgroup leaders within \nESA's regional legal organization.  This committee will meet at 10 o'clock am \nSao Paulo time on Tuesdays (other than on Brazilian holidays).  Either John \nNovak or Robert George will lead these meetings in my absence. The following \nattorneys should attend:\n\n John Novak, asset development & regional gas business activities\n Sami Arap, integrated projects & communications/fiber optics\n Robert George and Andrea Bertone, M&A / financial & physical originations\n George Frumkin, regional corporate\n Vasco de Castro Ferraz, Elektro\n  \nThe Regional General Counsels Meeting will be comprised of the chief lawyers \nfor TGS, Transredes, EPE and ESA's Gas Business Unit.  This committee will \nmeet at 5 o'clock pm Sao Paulo time on Wednesdays (other than on Brazilian \nholidays).  George Frumkin will lead these meetings in my absence. The \nfollowing attorneys should attend:\n\n Cristian Dougall, TGS\n Fernando Gonzalez, Transredes\n Ann Birosel, EPE\n Vicky Martinez, Gas Business Unit\n George Frumkin, ESA\n\nSince we intend to discuss matters relating to tax, trading and litigation, I \nbelieve it would be very helpful to have Rick Hopkinson (ESA Tax), Brent \nHendry (Enron North America, BA Office) and Bob Williams (Enron Litigation), \nor their designees, to attend these two meetings as well. \n\nParticularly in the Regional General Counsels Meeting, if there are matters \nwhich should be reported but which are not appropriate (for confidentiality, \nprivilege or other reasons) for discussion in front of the group, please let \nme know that you need to have an offline discussion, and I will call you back.\n\nMembers of the two committees will be receiving AT&T conference call numbers \nby separate e-mails. \n\nRandy Young\n\n\n\n\n", "entities": [{"claim": 2, "category": "other", "offset_start":

This \nproposal is based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov. \n17, 2000.\n\nDENA's proposal, which takes into account SDG&E's seasonal and hourly load \nrequirements and has a 3-percent annual adjustment for inflation, was \nincluded in comments DENA submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission last week in response to the commission's proposed remedies for \nCalifornia's electricity market.\n\nUnder DENA's proposal, SDG&E's business and residential customers no longer \nwould be exposed to the electricity price spikes they experienced this past \nsummer when their retail electricity prices often exceeded 18 cents per \nkilowatt-hour.\n\n``The 3,300 megawatts represent the full electricity load SDG&E needs to \nserve its retail customer base during the hottest summer day,'' said Jeff \nStokes, DENA executive vice president for the Western region. ``We again have \nstepped up with tangible, market-based solutions that can be implemented to \naddress the San Diego area's electricity price spikes. In addition to \nstabilizing customers' power bills, our proposal would also eliminate SDG&E's \nexposure to high wholesale electricity prices and the financial uncertainty \nthat goes along with that exposure.''\n\nCalifornia is facing high wholesale electricity prices largely because of \nsupply and demand imbalance, which has caused the California Independent \nSystem Operator (Cal-ISO) to call an unprecedented 20 ``Stage Two Electrical \nEmergencies'' thus far in 2000 when available electricity supplies have \nfallen below 5 percent. The primary causes for the electricity supply \nshortfall are the state's economic growth, the lack of new power plants being \nbuilt in California over the past decade, an aging generation fleet that \nrequires more maintenance and electricity imports being less available due to \neconomic growth throughout the West. California's electricity supply and \ndemand imbalance is expected to worsen or show little improvement until the \nsummers of 2002 and 2003, which is the earliest a substantial amount of new, \nmore efficient and cleaner power plants can be brought on line.\n\n``This is another key market-based solution to California's electricity \ncrisis made by Duke Energy over the past four months and we hope that it is \ngiven serious consideration,'' said Bill Hall, DENA vice president of asset \nmanagement for the Western region. ``The competitive wholesale electricity \nmarkets did not cause this electricity crisis; but with patience, wisdom and \nbold behavior by all market participants, we can fix the crisis and not \nburden the state's electricity ratepayers or taxpayers.''\n\nDENA has taken the following steps recently to address California's \nelectricity shortfall and high prices:\n\n\n    * On Nov. 16, DENA broke ground on its $525-million modernization of Moss\n      Landing Power Plant in Monterey County to upgrade the existing plant and\n      add 1,060 megawatts of new capacity to the site's current 1,500\n      megawatts.  When the modernization is completed, the plant will be\n      California's largest.  The project represents a substantial portion of\n      the new generation scheduled to come on line in California during summer\n      2002.\n\n    * On Nov. 15, DENA signed a wholesale electricity contract with Southern\n      California Edison to help manage price volatility and prevent price\n      spikes for their retail customers.  This followed a similar contract\n      that was signed with Pacific Gas & Electric on Oct. 30.  The specific\n      prices of the contracts are proprietary.\n\n    * On Oct. 23, DENA refiled with the California Energy Commission its\n      2,500-page application for certification to modernize the 1,000-megawatt\n      Morro Bay Power Plant.  The new 1,200-megawatt facility represents a\n      $600-million investment.  If the certification is received, DENA expects\n      to bring the new plant on line by summer 2003 and demolish the existing\n      plant by 2007.\n\n    * Finally, DENA has begun to work with City of Chula Vista officials to\n      accelerate the schedule for replacing the South Bay Power Plant with a\n      cleaner and more efficient facility.  Existing plans call for the plant\n      to be replaced in 2009.\n\n\nFor more information about DENA's California operations, power plant \nmodernization plans and position on California's electricity crisis, see the \nWeb site www.duke-energy.com/California.\n\nDENA is a leading wholesale energy services company.

They are the \n\"preliminary answer\" to your question and should be treated as so. Please \nkeep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal \nPerformance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept \nthat the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's \ncapacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average \ndegradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the \ntotal installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we \ntypically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval \nprocess (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers \nthat OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project \ncharacteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at \nthe net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed \nthese numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:\n\n1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, \ngas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses\n2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired\n3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired\n4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at \n$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot \nof stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, \nspares, etc, etc, etc)\n\nHope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described \nabove) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Rogers@ECT\n02/04/2000 09:39 AM\nTo: Scot Chambers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:  \n\nSubject: \n\nWith regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics \nregarding GE 7FA's.

We did more research and got the other groups involved so \nthat they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now \ncomfortable with our purchase decision.\n\nIn our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because \nwe had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche \nand Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have \naudited this application and have actually participated in numerous \nimplementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable \nResources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or \n6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for \nTractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we \nfelt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit \nconcerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be \nestablished, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of \nthose decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the \nproduct purchased work through the details of how we implement the new \nbusiness procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. \n\nRegarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all \nthe initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year \nmaintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with \nonly 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no \nelectronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially \nthe volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost \njustified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as \nwell.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We \ndid not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original \ncost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other \nquestions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to \ncompleting the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project \nunderway next week.

We believe the major issues\nare: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and\npersuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate\nthe expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment\ngrade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture\nplans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the\nwrite-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.\n\nIF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears\ncould become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,\ninvestor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the\nrating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings\nforce counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to\ngenerate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to\nclarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete\nexplanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to\nstabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road\nshow, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,\nthe stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can\npull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually\nthe stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over\nthe next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see\nbelow).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until\nENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\n\nENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur\nAnderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than\nan approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.\nWith no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset\ndivestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250\nMM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline\nfrom 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After\nthe close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,\nwe expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be\nbreak-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end\nof 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,\nand would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For\ncomparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.\ncoverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and\ninterest coverage is 3.8x.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's\nWholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be\nnoncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In\naddition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger\nthe issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible\npreferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured\nfinancing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an\n\ninvestment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a\npossible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook\nto negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market\ncapitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's\nfinancial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to\nrebuild its balance sheet.\n\nBREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM\nEBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are\nconservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but\nwe are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas\nPipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x\nmultiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.\nTotal asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B\nor $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,\nif ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its\nWholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving\nlittle for equity investors.\n\nPOTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio\nincludes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)\nthat has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the\nlast 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes\nElektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS\n(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.\nThese assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it\nhas reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not\nimpaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of\nthese assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would\nreduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.\nIt is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global\nAssets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other\nsegments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.\n\nADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and\nhave not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading\nvolume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have\nbought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing\nbusiness is strong and the belief that the equity markets have\nover-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights\nsolidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete\ndiscussion with the street?).\n\nTHE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its\nattorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with\nthe SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow\nparticipated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal\nwrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative\nconcern over the appearance of the transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************\n*************************\n\n\nThis e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons &\nCompany International believes to be reliable, but Simmons & Company\nInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

Since Duke is transporting and paying fuel and commodity to deliver there (rather than pooling), I am OK with this from a marketing perspective.  However, since this pool was established to separate Bushton Tailgate gas from other 16A gas, are you OK with this?  Their other alternative is to Pool to Mid 16A pool using MPS for free and then the downstream shipper would have to pay fuel and commodity when they take it away (netting a lower price to Duke).  I don't know if they are meeting some obligation for Tailgate gas using Pony gas as an option.

We've gotten far more \nrequests for information than we expected, so as a result I will be remaining \nin London a little longer than originally expected.

I know that space is a premium here \n- and I understand that I may need to move around some as a result.  I \ncertainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but I also \nwanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that \nare essential for the daily trader support in London and Houston.  As such, \nif I move, we will need to make sure that these applications are available \nfrom the beginning of the day (we start about 0600).  The applications are:\n\n1)  Adobe Acrobat - Full Version\n2) AccuWeather For Windows - (This is something I will need to install)\n3) Microsoft Front Page\n4) Terminal Server\n5) The full MS Office software package\n\nOne idea would be to have a PC move with me - that way we would not need to \nreinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support \nroutine.\n\nThanks again for all of your help.

Every Summer.\n \nKidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.\n \nIn 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.\n \nKidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.\n \nWe are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   \n\n\nEnron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction. \n\nWe'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate. There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor. \n\nAlso in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants. We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday. \n\nHouston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor. Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area. On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies. We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow. \n\nWe'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas. South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America. \n\nAlso from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter. Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. \n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday. West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access. \n\nKym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity. This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world. Kym will bring us details on Thursday. \n\nFinally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15. Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. \n\nFrom ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings. And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings. Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. \n\nKeep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.

McDonough is also chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision which recently completed a new accord on bank capital standards.\n\nThere is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen financial institutions\nat the national and international level in order to create more crisis\nresistant economies, McDonough said. But there is no comparable degree of\nconsensus on how to best handle international financial crises once they do\nerupt.\n\n\"In particular, there is unease that the current approach to crisis\nmanagement that has evolved out of the experiences in Mexico and Asia,\nnotwithstanding its successes in some cases, entails solutions that are\npotentially too costly,\" he said.\n\nCritics feel the solutions entailed repeated reliance on large-scale support\npackages, introduced adverse incentives, or moral hazard, and were in\nthemselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability, McDonough\nadded.\n\nHe advocated a flexible case-by-case approach to crisis management, adding\nthat regulators should strive for minimalist intervention.\n\nThe role of regulators is not to limit banks opportunities for growth and\nprofit. \"At the same time, if we encourage responsible behavior, we must not\ncreate the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not\nsucceed,\" he said.\n\n\nMcDonough Advocates Flexible Approach To Prevent, Cope With Financial Crises\n\nBNA - May 4, 2001\nBy Jeffrey Goldfarb\n\nA flexible, case-by-case approach, with minimal intervention by regulators,\nis the best way to prevent and cope with financial crises, said William\nMcDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and\nchairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nSpeaking May 3 in Frankfurt, Germany, McDonough said bank supervisors around\nthe world should be working to enable banks to better manage their\nbusinesses and their risks. \"At the same time, if we are to encourage\nresponsible behavior, we must not create the illusion that we will rescue\nevery institution that does not succeed,\" he said.\n\nMcDonough said that disclosure practices by banks, although improved over\nthe past decade, have not kept up with the many changes in the way they\nmanage their risk. He recommended that banks rethink what they consider\nproprietary information.\n\n\"It is critical to approach the question of disclosure as users of financial\nstatements,\" he said. \"Shareholders, creditors and counterparties cannot\nunderstand the risks of their own exposures to a bank until they first\nunderstand that bank's appetite for risk and its approach to, and\nmethodologies for, managing risk. What should drive this debate is market\nparticipants' need for information to make sound and secure credit and\ninvestment decisions, rather than the concerns some have about what was once\nconsidered secret.\"\n\nAmidst his remarks, an advance text of which was released in New York,\nMcDonough briefly commented on the state of the global economy, saying there\nare some unfavorable signals. \"During the latter part of the 1990s, the\ninternational financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in\nthe post-war period, and currently we again are seeing signs of strain\nassociated with the global slowdown in growth,\" he said.\n\nMcDonough explained that the solutions to recent crises in Mexico and Asia,\neven though successful, may have led to certain currently held tenets that\nare too costly, introduce adverse incentives or moral hazards, and are in\nthemselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability.\n\n\"But the alternatives,\" he said, \"look even more unpalatable in their\nimplications. Notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private\nlevel to search for a better way, no magic bullet formula has been found.\nNor is one likely to be available.\"\n\nIn essence, McDonough said, the quest for some broad, universal solution to\nfinancial crises is a Pollyannalike pursuit. \"If history is any guide,\" he\nsaid, \"new developments in markets and practices quickly will render\nobsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to today's\ncircumstances.\"\n\nFor that reason, McDonough encouraged a \"supremely tactical\" and creative\ncase-by-case approach to handling crises.\n\nHe specifically argued against standstill solutions, which suspend debt\nservice, usually in conjunction with the imposition of capital controls.\nMcDonough said that approach, in his opinion, could make investors skittish\nand make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments.\nStandstills also undermine market discipline of and ownership by the local\nauthorities, he said.\n\n\"To sum up, I believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the\nstandstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to\nbe,\" he said. \"The only thing that strikes me as predictable under such an\napproach would be that market access would be harmed across the board. Just\nas bailouts may encourage too much risk taking, efforts to orchestrate\npreemptive bail-ins may encourage too little.\"\n\n\nGramm Says Changed Markets Demand Dramatic Review, Reform of Securities Laws\n\nBNA - May 4, 2001\nBy Rachel Witmer\n\nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm (R-Texas) said May 3 that the\nchanges in the U.S. securities markets since the 1930s, and especially in\nthe last 10 years, demand a \"dramatic review and reform\" of securities\nregulation.\n\nGramm had previously announced his intention to conduct a top-to-bottom\nreview all of the securities laws with the intention of modernizing them.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of the Security Traders Association, Gramm said that\nthe review will be open-ended, and that he will not prejudge the conclusions\nfrom the effort. The senator said that the question he asks in looking at\nlaws and regulations is \"Are the benefits of this regulation in the market\nas it exists today worth what we're paying for them?\"\n\nIn addition, he emphasized that there will continue to be \"dramatic\" change\nin the markets and said, \"I want the change to be dictated by the markets\nand not the government.\" One change that he suggested might come \"in the\nlong run\" is that securities markets, per se, could become a thing of the\npast. \"I'm not certain that markets are not obsolete,\" he said.\n\nLater in his remarks, Gramm clarified his statement, saying \"I don't know if\nmarkets make sense any more.\" He made an analogy between markets and\ntraditional book stores, which have serious competition from online book\nstores. \"The Internet has revolutionized the book market,\" Gramm said. He\nthen asked, \"Is a centralized market necessary?\"\n\n\nNYSE's Survival\n\nAt another point in his remarks, Gramm suggested that as all-electronic\nmarkets are proliferating and changing competition in the securities\nmarkets, the New York Stock Exchange's \"survival is not guaranteed.\"\n\nIn other comments, Gramm emphasized that while he may refer an individual to\nthe White House for consideration as a potential nominee for the\nchairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \"the president is\ngoing to name the chairman and not me.\" Asked about the length of time it is\ntaking for the White House to nominate someone for that position, Gramm\nsaid, \"I don't see that any great harm is coming from it.\"\n\nGramm told reporters after his remarks that he hoped the administration will\nnominate someone who was \"knowledgeable, open-minded and free market.\"\nFinding all those qualities on one person is \"hard,\" he said.\n\nOn the topic of decimals, Gramm said that he did not see the recent\ndecimalization of the securities markets as a \"fundamental reform.\" As of\nApril 9, all securities are priced and traded in decimals instead of\nfractions. While on the House side there is some interest in exploring the\neffects of decimalization, Gramm said \"I don't see anything in it now that\nwould induce me to want to go back and hold hearings about it.\"\n\n\nLack of banking safeguards in HK\nFinancial Times - May 4, 2001\nBy Joe Leahy\n\nHong Kong lacks many of the formal safeguards in place in the UK and\nAustralia to protect banking consumers, said a study yesterday by the\nterritory's de facto central bank, Joe Leahy reports from Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has no general competition law, no regulator with an explicit\nmandate for protecting banking consumers and no ombudsman scheme to process\ncomplaints, the consultative study by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n(HKMA) found.\n\n\"As the Hong Kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more\ncompetitive, and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore, it is\ntimely to consider whether the current arrangements in Hong Kong remain\nappropriate,\" it said. .\n\nDespite its pro-business bias, Hong Kong has been forced to re-examine the\nissue of depositor protection following moves to deregulate the banking\nsector.\n\n\nJapan 'risks slide into downward spiral'\nFinancial Times - May 4, 2001\nBy Gillian Tett\n\nFalling exports to Asia and the US and the fragility of its banking system\nmean Japan risks sliding into a downward spiral with severe regional\nconsequences for trade, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment warned yesterday in its latest half-yearly report.\n\nThe OECD report says Japan may need to bail out the banks, a move the\ngovernment has ruled out.\n\nThe report comes at a critical time for the new government of Prime Minister\nJunichiro Koizumi. The Paris-based think-tank attracts considerable respect\nin Japan, and Mr. Koizumi is due to make his inaugural speech to parliament\non Monday, in which he will set out the government's economic policy.\n\nThe OECD report asserts that the level of bad loans is probably larger than\nthe government admits, meaning that some banks may not have sufficient\ncapital to write off their bad debts. \"In some cases, (realistic write-offs)\nmight even wipe out the capital altogether, requiring banks to reduce the\nscale of their operations, raise capital in the market or seek public\nfinancial support,\" it says.\n\nThe condition of the banking system is likely to be a key focus of Mr.\nKoizumi's speech. He has pledged to introduce measures to clear out the bad\nloans rapidly, under pressure from countries such as the US. The government\ninsists the banks have sufficient capital to complete this task.\n\n\"Public funds should be injected only when the financial system faces a\ncrisis,\" Hakuo Yanagisawa, financial reform minister, said recently. Some\nY7,450bn (Dollars 61bn) of public funds were injected into the largest banks\nin 1999.\n\nBut many analysts and diplomats fear that without government help the banks\nwill be too weak to write off their bad loans rapidly.\n\nThe mountain of bad loans has damaged corporate confidence and left the\nfinancial sector reluctant to lend.\n\nHowever, forcing banks to cut their loans to unviable borrowers could lead\nto more bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the short term, the OECD\nadmits. \"Managing the loan clean-up will be a huge task for the authorities,\nin particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be\ncarried out in a short period of time,\" it says.\n\nThe timing of the clean-up is unfortunate, since Japan is suffering the\nknock-on effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy, through\nlower exports.\n\nThe OECD suggests that if more funds are injected into the banks, that the\nbank managers should be sacked and the shareholders should not be rescued.\nHowever, any fresh injections of public funds could trigger strong public\nprotest. It could also fuel Japan's spiraling debt burden which is projected\nto hit 158 per cent of GDP in 2006 - and 138 per cent next year.\n\nThe OECD calculates the government will need to tighten fiscal policy by 10\npercentage points of GDP by 2010 simply to stabilise the debt.\n\nThis is currently equivalent to Y55,000bn, a sum exceeding total central\ngovernment tax revenue. On current growth trends, tax revenue would\ntherefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side\nalone.\n\nThe OECD added that monetary policy would need to be highly supportive. It\nexpects to see 1 per cent growth in calendar 2001 and 1.1 per cent growth\nnext year, higher than many analysts are projecting.\n\n\nAccounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits\nAmerican Banker - May 4, 2001\n\nFRANKFURT- Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's largest bank, said Thursday that\nfirst-quarter earnings rose 7%, fueled by lower taxes and a new accounting\nrule for derivatives, even as revenue from investment banking declined.\n\nNet income climbed to $920 million, or $1.68 a share. The results included a\ngain of $208 million from the accounting change.\n\nChief executive Rolf Breuer is trying to reduce Deutsche Bank's reliance on\ninvestment banking and emphasize businesses such as fund management and\nconsumer banking. Rivals in the securities business, including Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc., reported lower profit in the first quarter. Deutsche Bank said\nits investment banking revenue declined 1%.\n\nAnother rival reported a similar expectation. \"I expect to see growth from\nasset management and personal banking this year7 said Helmut Hipper, who\nhelps manage about $53.4 billion at Union Invest GmbH in Frankfurt.\n\"Investment banking won't be the main driver.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank shares fell Thursday by 0.75%, after having risen 2.8% in\nearly trading.\nWithout the accounting gain, profit was down 17% in the first quarter. Under\na new International Accounting Standards Board rule called IAS 39, changes\nin the value of certain derivatives were included in trading income for the\nfirst time.\n\n\"If we take away the accounting change, profit was down in the first\nquarter,\" said Manfred Bleijenberg, an analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank in\nAmsterdam, who is recommending that clients \"accumulate\" shares of Deutsche\nBank.\n\nThe company said its tax bill in the first three months declined 38%.\nGermany cut its corporate tax rate this year to 25% from 40%.\n\nHowever revenue from the bank's private client and asset management division\ndeclined slightly, to $1.79 billion from $1.87 billion, and revenue from\ncorporate and investment banking declined to $4.47 billion from $4.52\nbillion.\n\nIn a letter sent to shareholders Thursday, Mr. Breuer said, \"We want to\nexpand our market position in all important areas of business in the current\nfinancial year. He added, \"We expect from this an improvement in our profit\nsituation compared with our competition.\"\n\n\nArgentina's strife not over yet\nFinancial Times - May 4, 2001\nBy Thomas Catan\n\nFor the past six months, Argentina's markets have been dominated by a single\nquestion: can the country restart its economy in time to avoid a default on\nits Dollars 128bn in debt?\n\nThe answer is not yet clear. In his first six weeks back in charge of the\neconomy, Domingo Cavallo has done much to improve a bad situation after\nnearly three years of recession.\n\nHe has transformed a fractious political scene and restored the backing of\nthe International Monetary Fund.\n\nHis task was complicated by the fact that Argentina missed its first quarter\nfiscal target.\n\nMr. Cavallo has taken a range of measures to rein in the burgeoning fiscal\ndeficit to meet the Dollars 6.5bn target agreed with the IMF for this year.\n\nMost recently, he moved to eliminate virtually all exemptions on value added\ntax, cut Dollars 900m in spending and increased a tax on financial\ntransactions from 0.25 per cent to 0.4 per cent.\n\nBut those steps have only increased concern that Argentina will not climb\nout of recession, in spite of his prediction this week that the economy will\nbe growing at a 5 per cent clip in the last quarter of the year.\n\nMr. Cavallo's strategy is unconventional. To restart growth, he has\neliminated import tariffs on capital goods to encourage investment, as well\nas cut VAT on those items from 21 per cent to 10.5 per cent.\n\nHe will also unveil a series of \"competitiveness plans\" for sectors of\nindustry that have been hurt by the overvaluation of the peso over the past\ncouple of years.\n\nThe aim is to regain competitiveness without breaking the decade-old peg to\nthe dollar, which would be disastrous in a country where the vast majority\nof public and private sector debt is denominated in dollars.\n\nBut investors still question whether the strategy can work, and have pushed\ninterest rates up to astronomical levels.\n\nBecause of those rates, Argentina has long been unable to borrow on\ninternational markets.\n\nLast week it was forced for the first time to cancel a bi-weekly auction of\ntreasury bills.\n\nInvestors will be watching closely to see if Argentina can hold its next\nscheduled auction on May 8. If it cannot, then the fears that the country\nwill have to restructure its debt will again grow stronger, stoking\nvolatility throughout emerging markets.\nFollowing a brief rally at the start of the year, Argentina's stock market\nhas again languished.\n\nBut razor-thin trading volumes make the country's Merval a poor indicator of\nmarket sentiment. Over the past couple of months it has hovered in a range\nof 400 to 460. Yesterday by mid-session the Merval slipped 6.59 to 416.74.\n\nIt is the country's bonds that investors will be looking at. They account\nfor nearly a quarter of the benchmark emerging market debt index, and any\nrestructuring could spell trouble for such markets around the world.\n\n\n\n\nScott Marra\nAdministrator for Policy & Media Relations\nISDA\n600 Fifth Avenue\nRockefeller Center - 27th floor\nNew York, NY 10020\nPhone: (212) 332-2578\nFax: (212) 332-1212\nEmail: smarra@isda.org\n\n\n\nScott Marra\nAdministrator for Policy & Media Relations\nISDA\n600 Fifth Avenue\nRockefeller Center - 27th floor\nNew York, NY 10020\nPhone: (212) 332-2578\nFax: (212) 332-1212\nEmail: smarra@isda.org", "entities": [{"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 36, "offset_end": 40, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 645, "offset_end": 649, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 2868, "offset_end": 2872, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "other", "offset_start": 6660, "offset_end": 6661, "target_num": "3"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 10306, "offset_end": 10310, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 9387, "offset_end": 9391, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 6754, "offset_end": 6756, "target_num": "10"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 6573, "offset_end": 6577, "target_num": "2001"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "other", "offset_start": 3181, "offset_end": 3182, "target_num": "3"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "other", "offset_start": 665, "offset_end": 666, "target_num": "3"}, {"claim": 2, "category": "date", "offset_start": 91, "offset_end": 95, "target_num": "2001"}]}, {"paragraph": "Subject: July 16 2001 Advisory Statements\nFrom: dcongel@nyiso.com\n\n\nDCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:\n\nMarket Participants:\n\nIn the early evening hours on 8/8/2001 the NYISO inadvertently ran a\nbilling job for\n7/16/2001.

But Handspring (NASDAQ:HAND) fell on an earnings warning.\n\nDuring the day, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 1.32 to 73.68, breaking out\nof a 10-month base.\n\nChip stocks surged 7.7% after National Semi (NYSE:NSM), up 3.07 to 31.04,\nbeat estimates with a breakeven quarter and said the worst may be behind\nthe industry. Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), up 5.14 to 40.71, warned but said it\nis seeing an improvement in orders that could lead to a rebound later this\nyear.\n\nS1 (NASDAQ:SONE), the best-performing Net stock last month, soared 2.35 to\n13.85 on an alliance with IBM (NYSE:IBM).\n\nLoudeye (NASDAQ:LOUD) soared .58 to 1.79 on a deal with Napster.\n\nCheck Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) rebounded 3.31 to 52.50 on comments from First\nUnion that the sell-off in the stock was overdone.\n\nSalomon Smith Barney handicapped the winners and losers from the SuperComm\nconference. The firm was cautious on Redback (NASDAQ:RBAK), Juniper\n(NASDAQ:JNPR) and Nortel (NYSE:NT), and positive on Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),\nExtreme (NASDAQ:EXTR) and Foundry (NASDAQ:FDRY).\n\nSome technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the\ntechnical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail\nnewsletter version, try this link:\nhttp://www.afterhourstrading.com/column.html\n\nThe Nasdaq broke through 2252 resistance today and is clearly headed\nhigher tomorrow. Tonight we're going to take a look at the bigger picture\nsince the April lows and see what's forming, because at least for now, the\nchart patterns forming off the lows look mainly bearish. The Nasdaq (first\nchart) and Nasdaq 100 (second chart) could be forming either bearish\nrising wedges (the black lines), or head and shoulders tops (the blue\nlines). Our best guess is that they're rising wedges, and that those upper\ntrendlines will be reached in the near-term, but that's just a guess based\non the surprising strength in the market. However, at least one cycle\nwatcher is expecting a significant peak in the June 18-June 26 timeframe.\nThose patterns make 2100-2150 on the Nasdaq and 1760-1850 on the Nasdaq\n100 important support. A look at two possible outcomes: the Nasdaq 100's\nbearish rising wedge rally of last summer (third chart), and the Dow's\nbullish negation of a rising wedge at 10,300 in mid-April and subsequent\nnicely-formed uptrend (fourth chart). We'll watch the charts for clues as\nto how these patterns will resolve. Also notice that the S&P 500 (fifth\nchart) and S&P 100 (sixth chart) could be forming head and shoulders tops\nwithin otherwise nicely shaped uptrends. Note that the Dow and S&P 100\nbounced off their uptrend lines today.\n\n\n\nSpecial report: For a free introduction to technical chart patterns and an\noverview of last year's action in the stock market, visit\nhttp://www.internetstockreport.com/guest/article/0,1785,2571_500051,00.html.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Neither internet.com nor the writers of this newsletter makes\nspecific trading recommendations or gives individualized market advice.\nInformation contained in this newsletter is provided as an information\nservice only.  internet.com recommends that you get personal advice from\nan investment professional before buying or selling stocks or other\nsecurities.

Gray Davis \nclaims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May \n2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. \n\nOf the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from \nthe October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC \nlacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent \nSystem Operator.  \n   \nThat leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could \npotentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. \n\nTalks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in \nunpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC \nadministrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will \nlikely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis \nexpects. \n\nDavis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., \"with one goal, \nand that is to bring back $9 billion.\" \n\nNearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO \ndocuments show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, \nfor example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. \n\nDavid Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general \nmanager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but \nconceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. \n\nDavis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork \nfor the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from \ncorporate energy suppliers. \n\nBut during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press \nsecretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about \ngetting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated \nby FERC. \n\nDavis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators \novercharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. \n\nState Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation \ninto Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on \"shaky \ncalculations.\" \n\nTo come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices \nreceived by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been \nexpected under competitive market conditions. \n\nThe ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at \ntimes about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices \nin the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with \nair-quality rules. \n\nThe ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern \nborder, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the \nfuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. \n\nThe ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's \"Big Five\" power \nsuppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the \nconclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. \n\nThe ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest \nutilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid \noperator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the \ndocuments. \n\nThe ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed \namounts between May 2000 and February: \n\nAmerican Electric Power Service Corp.

This supersedes my last \ntransmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI \nfor a grouped series of bases in California.\n\n 1.  Navy, Southwest. \n\n  a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled \nbasis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do \nlife cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A \ndraft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP, \noptimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as \nearly as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more \nrealistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC \nBusiness Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting \nthis month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up. \n  b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas, \nwater, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern \nCalifornia.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval \nAir Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons \nStation, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal \nBeach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).    \n\n 2.  Marines,Southwest.  \n\n  a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD \nSan Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in \nthe case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for \nBarstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to \nhit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.\n\n  b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a \nsmall base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The \ncombination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.  \nThe real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is \ncurrently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few \nmonths later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.\n\n 3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their \nNorthwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following \nlocations:\n\n  -Naval Subase bangor\n  -Camp Wesley Harris\n  -Olalla Housing\n  -Port Hadlock\n  -Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport\n  -Naval Station Bremerton\n  -Naval Hospital Bremerton\n  -Jackson Park Naval Houising\n  -Naval Fuel Depot Manchester\n  -Naval Station Everett\n  -Naval Radio Station Jim Creek\n  -MWR Pacific Beach\n  -Naval Air Station Whidbey Island\n  \nEFSI was invited to present at their Industry forum in Seattle where this \nprocurement was announced on 4 Aug 99.  An  RFI is out, with response due 15 \nNov 99.  The final RFP is scheduled to be released in Jan 01.\n\n 4.  Joint Regional Privatization Project (JRUPP) Alaska.

DESC is the project manager.  An \nRFI for these locations just hit the street.  Our retired friend, USAF COL \nDon Michael Bradford instigated this joint procurement, and is still a good \nsource of information in the Pacific.  Procurement is being accelerated with \nthe USAF catching up to where the Army is, so schedule for an RFP is \ncurrently unknown.
